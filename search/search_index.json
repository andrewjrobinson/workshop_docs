If not, then you should take\na look at the \nHands-on Unix Workshop\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nBefore we commence the hands-on part of this workshop we will first give a short 30 minute talk to introduce the High Performance Computing concepts. \nThe \nslides\n are available if you would like.  Additionally the following reference material is available for later\nuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference Material\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an HPC?\n\n\nAn HPC is simply a large collection of server-grade computers working together to solve large problems.\n\n\n\n\nBig\n: HPCs typically have lots of CPUs and Memory and consequently large jobs.\n\n\nShared\n: There are usually lots of users making use of it at one time\n\n\nCoordinated\n: There is a coordinator program to ensure fair-use between its users\n\n\nCompute Collection\n: HPCs use a number of computers at once to solve lots of large jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure\n: The user (face at top) interacts with their local PC/Laptop through the keyboard and screen.  The PC/Laptop will \nconnect to the Head/Login node of the HPC interactively.  The Head/Login node will send the jobs off to the Compute Nodes when\none is available. \n\n\nWhy use HPCs?\n\n\nThe main reason we use HPCs is because they are quite big.  Given their size, they are usually very expensive, however through \nsharing the resources the per user/job cost can be kept low.\n\n\n\n\nMany CPUs\n: HPCs typically have 100's to 10000's of CPUs.  Compare this with the 4 or 8 that your PC/Laptop might have.\n\n\nLarge Memory\n: 100's of GBs to multiple TBs of RAM are typical for each node.\n\n\nEfficient use\n: through sharing the resources each user can have access to a very large computer for a period and hand \nit back for others to use later.\n\n\n\n\nSoftware Modules\n\n\nThere are typically 100's to 1000's of software packages installed on an HPC.  Given that each can have its own special \nrequirements and multiple versions will be made, Software on the HPC will most commonly be packaged and only made available \nto you when you request it.\n\n\n\n\nPackaged\n: to avoid conflicts between software, each is packaged up into a module and only used on demand.\n\n\nLoadable\n: before using a software module you need to load it.\n\n\nVersions\n: given not all users want to use the same version of software (and to compare new results with old you might \n   need the same version)    each version is made into its own software module so you have ultimate control.\n\n\n\n\nJob Submission\n\n\nJob Submission is the process of instructing the HPC to perform a task for you.  Depending on the HPC software installed on \nyour HPC, the process of doing so might be different.\n\n\n\n\nSLURM\n: this workshop uses an HPC that uses the SLURM HPC software.  Some common alternatives (not covered) are PBS or \n   SGE/OGE\n\n\nQueues (Partition)\n: when a job is submitted it is added to a work queue; in SLURM this is called a Partition.\n\n\nBatch\n: HPC jobs are not 'interactive'.  By this we mean, you can't type input into your job's programs and you won't \n   immediately see the output that your program prints on the screen. \n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\nSo that SLURM knows how to schedule and fit jobs around each other, you need to specify what resources your job will use.\nThat is, you need to tell it how many CPUs, RAM, Nodes (servers), and Time you need.\n\n\n\n\nCPUs\n: most software is limited using 1 CPU by default but many can use more than one (or you can run multiple copies at once).\n   The number of CPUs you specify needs to match how many things your software can do at once.\n\n\nMemory\n: you need to estimate (or guess) how much memory (RAM) your program needs.\n\n\nNodes\n: most software will only use one of the HPC's Nodes (i.e. One server) however some software can make use of more than\n   one to solve the problem sooner.\n\n\nTime\n: like when you are scheduling meetings, SLURM needs to know how long each job will take (maximum) so it can organise\n   other jobs afterwards.\n\n\n\n\nJob Types\n\n\nThere are two types of jobs that you can submit:\n\n\n\n\nShared\n: a shared job (as the name suggests) is one that shares a node with other jobs.  This is the default and preferred method.\n\n\nExclusive\n: an exclusive job gets a single (or multiple) nodes to itself.  Given this exclusivity, this type of job must know how \n   to use multiple CPUs as most HPCs will have at least 16 CPUs per node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//<![CDATA[<!--\n(function(w,d,u){if(!w.$){w._delayed=true;console.info(\"Delaying JQuery calls\");w.readyQ=[];w.bindReadyQ=[];function p(x,y){if(x==\"ready\"){w.bindReadyQ.push(y);}else{w.readyQ.push(x);}};var a={ready:p,bind:p};w.$=w.jQuery=function(f){if(f===d||f===u){return a}else{p(f)}}}})(window,document)\n//-->]]>\n\n\n\n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink0\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable0\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use this workshop\n\n\nThe workshop is broken up into a number of \nTopics\n each focusing on a particular aspect of HPCs.  You should take a short break between \neach to refresh and relax before tackling the next.\n\n\nTopic\ns may start with some background followed by a number of \nexercises\n.  Each \nexercise\n begins with a \nquestion\n, then \nsometimes a \nhint\n (or two) and finishes with the suggested \nanswer\n.\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nAn example question looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Answer to Life?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\nDepending on how much of a challenge you like, you may choose to use hints.  Even if you work out the answer without hints, its a good \nidea to read the hints afterwards because they contain extra information that is good to know.\n\n\nNote: \nhint\ns may be staged, that is, there may be a \nmore\n section within a hint for further hints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n \n- click here to reveal hint\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the answer to everything?\n\n\nAs featured in \n\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n \n- and here to show more\n\n\n\n\nIt is probably a two digit number\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink3\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable3\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n            if ($(\"#showable3\").hasClass(\"showable-hidden\")) {\n                $(\"#showablelink3\").text(\"More\");\n            } else {\n                $(\"#showablelink3\").text(\"Less\");\n            }\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink2\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable2\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n    \n\n\nAnswer\n\n\nOnce you have worked out the answer to the question expand the Answer section to check if you got it correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n \n- click here to reveal answer\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n: 42\n\n\nRef: \nNumber 42 (Wikipedia)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink4\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable4\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n    \n\n\nUsage Style\n\n\nThis workshop attempts to cater for two usage styles:\n\n\n\n\nProblem solver\n: for those who like a challenge and learn best be trying to solve the problems by-them-selves (hints optional):\n\n\nAttempt to answer the question by yourself.\n\n\nUse hints when you get stuck.\n\n\nOnce solved, reveal the answer and read through our suggested solution.\n\n\nIts a good idea to read the hints and answer description as they often contain extra useful information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy example\n:  for those who learn by following examples:  \nExpand\n all sections\n\n\nExpand the Answer section at the start of each question and follow along with the commands that are shown and check you get the\n  same (or similar) answers.\n\n\nIts a good idea to read the hints and answer description as they often contain extra useful information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting to HPC\n\n\nTo begin this workshop you will need to connect to an HPC.  Today we will use the \nLIMS-HPC\n.  The computer called\n\n\nlims-hpc-m.latrobe.edu.au\n (m is for master which is another name for head node) is the \none that coordinates all the HPCs tasks.\n\n\nServer details\n:\n\n\n\n\nhost\n: \nlims-hpc-m.latrobe.edu.au\n\n\nport\n: \n6022\n \n\n\nusername\n: \ntrainingXX\n\n\npassword\n: \n(provided at workshop)\n\n\n\n\nConnection instructions\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac OS X / Linux\n\n\n\n\nBoth Mac OS X and Linux come with a version of ssh (called OpenSSH) that can be used from the command line.  To use OpenSSH you must \nfirst start a terminal program on your computer.  On OS X the standard terminal is called Terminal, and it is installed by default. \nOn Linux there are many popular terminal programs including: xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole (if you aren't sure, then xterm is a good \ndefault).  When you've started the terminal you should see a command prompt.  To log into \nLIMS-HPC\n, for example, type this command at \nthe prompt and press return (where the word username is replaced with your \nLIMS-HPC\n username):\n\n\n$ ssh -p \n6022\n \ntrainingXX\n@\nlims-hpc-m.latrobe.edu.au\n\n\nThe same procedure works for any other machine where you have an account except that if your Unix computer uses a port other than 22 you will\nneed to specify the port by adding the option \n-p PORT\n with PORT substituted with the port number.\n\n\nYou may be presented with a message along the lines of:\n\n\nThe authenticity of host 'lims-hpc-m.latrobe.edu.au (131.172.24.10)' can't be  established.\n...\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\n\n\n\n\nAlthough you should never ignore a warning, this particular one is nothing to be concerned about; type \nyes\n and then \npress enter\n. \nIf all goes well you will be asked to enter your password.  Assuming you type the correct username and password the system should \nthen display a welcome message, and then present you with a Unix prompt.  If you get this far then you are ready to start entering \nUnix commands and thus begin using the remote computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink5\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable5\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\n\n\nOn Microsoft Windows (Vista, 7, 8, 10) we recommend that you use the PuTTY ssh client.  PuTTY (putty.exe) can be downloaded \nfrom this web page:\n\n\nhttp://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html\n\n\nDocumentation for using PuTTY is here:\n\n\nhttp://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/docs.html\n\n\nWhen you start PuTTY you should see a window which looks something like this:\n\n\n\n\nTo connect to \nLIMS-HPC\n you should enter \nlims-hpc-m.latrobe.edu.au\n into the box entitled \"Host Name (or IP address)\" \nand \n6022\n in the port, \nthen click on the Open button. All of the settings should remain the same as they were when PuTTY started (which should be the \nsame as they are in the picture above).\n\n\nIn some circumstances you will be presented with a window entitled PuTTY Security Alert. It will say something along the lines \nof \n\"The server's host key is not cached in the registry\"\n. This is nothing to worry about, and you should agree to continue (by \nclicking on Yes). You usually see this message the first time you try to connect to a particular remote computer.\n\n\nIf all goes well, a terminal window will open, showing a prompt with the text \n\"login as:\"\n. An example terminal window is shown \nbelow. You should type your \nLIMS-HPC\n username and press enter. After entering your username you will be prompted for your \npassword. Assuming you type the correct username and password the system should then display a welcome message, and then \npresent you with a Unix prompt. If you get this far then you are ready to start entering Unix commands and thus begin using \nthe remote computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink6\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable6\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n    \n\n\nTopic 1: Exploring an HPC\n\n\nAn HPC (short for 'High Performance Computer') is simply a collection of Server Grade computers that work together to solve large problems.\n\n\n\n\nFigure\n: Overview of the computers involved when using an HPC.

While this is ok for small jobs \n on small HPCs like LIMS-HPC, it's unworkable for most jobs.  In this topic we will start to learn how to make use of the rest of the HPCs immense compute power\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nOn conventional Unix computers (such as the HPC headnode) we enter the commands we want to run at the terminal and see the results directly output\nin front of us.  On an HPC this type of computation will only make use of one node, namely, the \nHead Node\n.  To make use of the remaining (\ncompute\n) nodes\nwe need to use the SLURM software package (called an HPC Scheduler).  The purpose of SLURM is to manage all user jobs and distribute the available resources\n(i.e. time on the compute nodes) to each job in a fair manner.  You can think of the SLURM software as like an electronic \ncalendar\n and the user jobs like \n\nmeetings\n.  Users \nsay\n to SLURM \"I want XX CPUS for YY hours\" and SLURM will look at its current bookings and find the next available time it can fit the job.\n\n\nTerminology\n:\n\n\n\n\nNode\n: a server grade computer which is part of an HPC\n\n\nBatch Job\n: a group of one or more related Unix commands that need to be run (executed) for a user.  e.g. run fastqc on all my samples\n\n\nPartition (or Queue)\n: a list of jobs that need to be run.  There is often more than one partition on an HPC which usually have specific requirements \nfor the jobs that can be added to them.  e.g. \n8hour\n will accept jobs less than or equal to 8hours long\n\n\nRuntime\n: the amount of time a job is expected (or actually) runs\n\n\nResources\n: computation resources that can be given to our jobs in order to run them.  e.g. CPU Cores, Memory, and Time.\n\n\nJob Script\n: a special BASH script that SLURM uses to run a job on our behalf once resources become available.  Job scripts contain details of the \nresources that our commands need to run.\n\n\nOutput (or Results) file\n: When SLURM runs our batch job it will save the results that would normally be output on the terminal (screen) to a file; this file \nis called the output file.\n\n\nReservation\n: much like a reservation for a resturant holds a table for you, the administrator can give you an HPC reservation which holds various resources\nfor a period of time exclusively for you. \n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n\nUseful Commands\n: \nman, sinfo, cat, sbatch, squeue, cp, module, prime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1) Which nodes could a '\ntraining\n' job go on?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\nTry the \nsinfo\n command\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmore\n\n\n\n\nHave a look at the PARTITION and NODELIST columns.

This has already been done for your *training* account so no need to do this today\n\nLIMS-HPC Node Login Setup\n\n\n\n\nuse the *compute* partition instead of *training*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 1: Write a job script\n\n\nWrite a job script that requests the following resources:\n\n\n\n\nFilename\n: monINITIALS.slurm\n\n\nwhere INITIALS is replaced with your initials.  e.g. for me it would be monAR.slurm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTasks\n: 1 \n\n\nCPUs\n: 1\n\n\nPartition\n: \ntraining\n \n\n\nTime\n: 5 mins \n\n\nMemory\n: 1 GB (remember to specify it in MB)\n\n\n\n\nTask 2: Load/use software module\n\n\nEdit your job script so that it: \n\n\n\n\nLoads the \ntraining-gcc\n module\n\n\nRuns the \nfakejob\n command with your name as the first parameter.  \n\n\nFYI: \nfakejob\n is a command that was made to demonstrate what real commands\n  might do in terms of CPU and Memory usage.  It does not perform any useful task; if you must know, it just calculates prime numbers for 5 minutes \n  and consumes some memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n: remember good practice here and add the date commands to print the date/time in your output.  You can copy them from the *task01* script.\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: Submit job\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n: Task 4 is time dependent on task 3; you need to do it within 2 or 3 minutes of running step 3.1 so it might be a good idea to\nread ahead before hand.  Don't stress if you don't complete it in time, you can simply run 3.1 again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse \nsbatch\n to submit the job to the HPC.\n\n\nNote down the job id it was given (for later).\n\n\nUse squeue (or qs) to check that is started ok.\n\n\nWhen it starts check which compute node it is running on (for the next task).\n\n\n\n\nTask 4: Monitor the job\n\n\nUse the \ntop\n command to check how much CPU and Memory the job is using.  Given that SLURM is running the job on your behalf on one of the compute \nnodes, \ntop\n won't be able to see the job.  To be able to use top, you will first need to login to the compute node that is running your job.\n\n\nTo login:\n\n\n\n\n$ ssh lims-hpc-X\n\n\n\n\nWhere X is the actual node number you were allocated (See task 3.4).\n\n\nYou are now connected from your computer to lims-hpc-m which is connected to lims-hpc-X.\n\n\n+---------------+            +------------+            +------------+\n| YOUR COMPUTER | -- SSH --\n | LIMS-HPC-M | -- SSH --\n | LIMS-HPC-X |\n+---------------+            +------------+            +------------+\n\n\n\n\nYou can tell which node you are on by the text in the prompt\n\n\n[10:00:06] USERNAME@lims-hpc-m ~ $ \n\nChanges to:\n\n[10:06:05] USERNAME@lims-hpc-1 ~ $\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce logged in to the relevent compute node you can run \ntop\n to view your job.  Remember the \nu\n and \nc\n options we learnt earlier; they will be helpful \nhere when everyone is running the same jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the CPU and Memory usage change over time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\nIt should vary (within the limits you set in the job script)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink142\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable142\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\nThe \nfakejob\n program should vary its CPU usage between 50 and 100% CPU and 500 and 1000MB of memory.  The percentage that it shows is based on the total \nmemory of the node that runs your job; check Topic 4, Question 4.2 to remember how to find the total memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink143\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable143\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n    \n\n\n\n\nFinished\n\n\nWell done, you learnt a lot over the last 5 topics and you should be proud of your achievement; it \nwas a lot to take in.\n\n\nFrom here you should be comfortable to begin submitting real jobs to the HPC (in your real account, \nnot the training one).\n\n\nYou will no-doubt forget a lot of what you learnt here so I encourage you to save a link to this \nworkshop for later reference.\n\n\nThank you for your attendance, please don't forget to complete the training survey and give it\nback to the workshop facilitators.",

All of the settings should remain the same as they were when PuTTY started (which should be the \nsame as they are in the picture above).  In some circumstances you will be presented with a window entitled PuTTY Security Alert. It will say something along the lines \nof  \"The server's host key is not cached in the registry\" . This is nothing to worry about, and you should agree to continue (by \nclicking on Yes). You usually see this message the first time you try to connect to a particular remote computer.  If all goes well, a terminal window will open, showing a prompt with the text  \"login as:\" . An example terminal window is shown \nbelow. You should type your  LIMS-HPC  username and press enter. After entering your username you will be prompted for your \npassword. Assuming you type the correct username and password the system should then display a welcome message, and then \npresent you with a Unix prompt.

On an HPC this type of computation will only make use of one node, namely, the  Head Node .  To make use of the remaining ( compute ) nodes\nwe need to use the SLURM software package (called an HPC Scheduler).  The purpose of SLURM is to manage all user jobs and distribute the available resources\n(i.e. time on the compute nodes) to each job in a fair manner.  You can think of the SLURM software as like an electronic  calendar  and the user jobs like  meetings .  Users  say  to SLURM \"I want XX CPUS for YY hours\" and SLURM will look at its current bookings and find the next available time it can fit the job.  Terminology :   Node : a server grade computer which is part of an HPC  Batch Job : a group of one or more related Unix commands that need to be run (executed) for a user.  e.g. run fastqc on all my samples  Partition (or Queue) : a list of jobs that need to be run.  There is often more than one partition on an HPC which usually have specific requirements \nfor the jobs that can be added to them.  e.g.  8hour  will accept jobs less than or equal to 8hours long  Runtime : the amount of time a job is expected (or actually) runs  Resources : computation resources that can be given to our jobs in order to run them.  e.g. CPU Cores, Memory, and Time.  Job Script : a special BASH script that SLURM uses to run a job on our behalf once resources become available.  Job scripts contain details of the \nresources that our commands need to run.  Output (or Results) file : When SLURM runs our batch job it will save the results that would normally be output on the terminal (screen) to a file; this file \nis called the output file.  Reservation : much like a reservation for a resturant holds a table for you, the administrator can give you an HPC reservation which holds various resources\nfor a period of time exclusively for you.",

Your job may finish early, at which point it hands back the resources for the next job.  However if it \ntries to run longer the HPC will terminate the job. HINT : when selecting a time for your job its best to estimate your job runtime to be close to \nwhat it actually uses as it can help the HPC scheduler 'fit' your job in between other jobs though be careful to allow enough \ntime.  If you think your job may not complete in time you can ask the system administrator of your HPC to add more time.     \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink82\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable82\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n         3.7) Calculate the  --time  specification for the following runtimes:    1h30m: --time=  1m20s: --time=  1.5days: --time=  30m: --time=      \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink83\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable83\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n        Hint   Use the  man sbatch  command to look up the time specification.

Additionally the following reference material is available for later\nuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference Material\n\n\n\n\nWhy use unix\n\n\n\n\nPowerful\n: Unix computers are typically very powerful in comparision to your desktop/laptop computers.\n  Additionally they don't typically use a Graphical User Interface which can free up much resources for actual\n  computing.\n\n\nBig data\n: Unix programs are designed to handle large data sets\n\n\nFlexible\n: Small programs that can be arranged in many ways to solve your problems\n\n\nAutomation\n: Scripting allows you to do many tasks in one step and repeat steps many times\n\n\nPipelines\n: Unix programs are designed to be 'chained' together to form long multi-step pipelines\n\n\nScience Software\n: Lots of Scientific software is designed to run in a Unix environment\n\n\n\n\nUser interface\n\n\nThe Unix interface is a text-based command driven one; often known as a Command Line Interface (CLI).  This means \nthat you control it by issuing (i.e. typing) commands at the command prompt.  Consequently, the Mouse does not perform\nany function in the unix environment.\n\n\n\n\nCommand prompt\n\n\nThe command prompt is the first thing you see when you connect to a Unix Computer.  It's purpose is to receive the next\ncommand from you, the user.\n\n\n\n\nThere are several parts that make up the command prompt:\n\n\n\n\nTime\n: the time (when the last command finished)\n\n\nUsername\n: the username that you are logged in as\n\n\nHostname\n: the name of the computer that your are connected to\n\n\nCurrent working directory\n: the current position within the file system that your are working.  More to follow\n\n\nPrompt\n: this is simply a sign to the user that the computer is ready to accept the next command \n\n\n\n\nFrom this point forward in this document, the command prompt will be simply represented as a '$' rather than\nthe full command prompt as shown above.  When copying and pasting commands you should NOT copy the '$' sign.\n\n\nCommand line\n\n\nBelow is an example command with various flags and options.\n\n\n\n\nThere are a number of parts which may be included in a command; each is separated by one of more 'white-space' characters (i.e. space, tab):\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n: this is the name of the program (command) that you want to run\n\n\nFlag\n: these turn on (or off) specific features in the program.  They consist of a dash (-) followed by\n  a single character.\n\n\nLong flag\n: same as flag except they are generally two dashes (--) followed by a word (or two)\n\n\nOption\n: set the value of a configurable option.  They are a flag (or long flag) followed by a value\n\n\nAnonymous options\n: these are one or more options that are specified in the required order\n\n\nQuoted value\n: if you need to specify a space (or tab) in an option then you will need to use double (\") or \n  single (') quotes on each side of the value. \n\n\n\n\nFile system\n\n\nThe file-system of a unix computer can be thought of as an up-side-down tree.  The top most directory has a special name\ncalled 'root'; it contains all files and directories that are on the computer system.  It is represented by a single \nslash (/).  The figure below shows an example file system with directories (black outline boxes) and files (grey dashed \nboxes).\n\n\n\n\nAt the top level we have one file (settings) and one directory (home).  Inside the home directory we have two directories\n(user1 and user2) and so on.\n\n\nAbsolute file names\n\n\nAbsolute file names are a single unique name for each file and directory within the computer.  They start with the slash (/)\ncharacter and follow all the parent directories above the file/directory.\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute file name\n: \n/settings\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute file name\n: \n/home/user1/file01.txt\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute file name\n: \n/home/user2\n  \n\n\nNote\n: the final slash is not needed (but generally doesn't hurt if it is present).\n\n\nCurrent working directory\n\n\nThe \ncurrent working directory\n is the current location within the file system that you are currently using. \nWhen you first login to a unix computer it will begin with the current working directory set to your home directory, that \nis, a place that is unique to you and generally nobody else will have access to it.\n\n\n\n\nRemember from earlier that the current working directory is shown in the command prompt.\n\n\nRelative file names\n\n\nRelative file names are a short cut to writing file names that are shorter.  The difference between an absolute file\nname is that relative file names do NOT begin with a slash.\n\n\n\n\nIf your current working directory is set to \n/home\n you can leave this part from the beginning of the filename.\n\n\nRelative file name\n: \nuser1/muscle.fq\n\n\n(Note: the absence of the leading slash)\n\n\nSpecial file names\n:\n\n\nThere are a few further short cuts for typing relative file names:\n\n\n\n\n~\n (Tilde): is a short cut to your home directory\n\n\n.\n (dot): is a short cut for the current directory\n\n\n..\n (2x dot): means the parent (or one directory up) from current directory\n\n\n...\n (3x dot): does not mean anything (a got-ya for new users).  If you want 2 directories up then chain two \ndouble dot's  e.g. \n../..\n \n\n\n\n\nNote\n: the special file names above can be used within absolute and relative file name and used multiple times.\n\n\n\n\nNow, if the current working directory is changed to \n/home/user2\n the relative path to muscle.fq is different.\n\n\nRelative file name\n: \n../user1/muscle.fq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//<![CDATA[<!--\n(function(w,d,u){if(!w.$){w._delayed=true;console.info(\"Delaying JQuery calls\");w.readyQ=[];w.bindReadyQ=[];function p(x,y){if(x==\"ready\"){w.bindReadyQ.push(y);}else{w.readyQ.push(x);}};var a={ready:p,bind:p};w.$=w.jQuery=function(f){if(f===d||f===u){return a}else{p(f)}}}})(window,document)\n//-->]]>\n\n\n\n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink0\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable0\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n    \n\n\n\n\nTopic 1: Remote log in\n\n\nIn this topic we will learn how to connect to a \nUnix\n computer via a method called \nSSH\n and run a few basic commands.\n\n\nConnecting to a Unix computer\n\n\nTo begin this workshop you will need to connect to an HPC.  Today we will use the \nLIMS-HPC\n.  The computer called \n\nlims-hpc-m.latrobe.edu.au\n (m is for master which is another name for head node) is the \none that coordinates all the HPCs tasks.\n\n\nServer details\n:\n\n\n\n\nhost\n: \nlims-hpc-m.latrobe.edu.au\n\n\nport\n: \n6022\n \n\n\nusername\n: \ntrainingXX\n\n\npassword\n: \n(provided at workshop)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac OS X / Linux\n\n\n\n\nBoth Mac OS X and Linux come with a version of ssh (called OpenSSH) that can be used from the command line.  To use OpenSSH you must \nfirst start a terminal program on your computer.  On OS X the standard terminal is called Terminal, and it is installed by default. \nOn Linux there are many popular terminal programs including: xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole (if you aren't sure, then xterm is a good \ndefault).  When you've started the terminal you should see a command prompt.  To log into \nLIMS-HPC\n, for example, type this command at \nthe prompt and press return (where the word username is replaced with your \nLIMS-HPC\n username):\n\n\n$ ssh -p \n6022\n \ntrainingXX\n@\nlims-hpc-m.latrobe.edu.au\n\n\nThe same procedure works for any other machine where you have an account except that if your Unix computer uses a port other than 22 you will\nneed to specify the port by adding the option \n-p PORT\n with PORT substituted with the port number.\n\n\nYou may be presented with a message along the lines of:\n\n\nThe authenticity of host 'lims-hpc-m.latrobe.edu.au (131.172.24.10)' can't be  established.\n...\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\n\n\n\n\nAlthough you should never ignore a warning, this particular one is nothing to be concerned about; type \nyes\n and then \npress enter\n. \nIf all goes well you will be asked to enter your password.  Assuming you type the correct username and password the system should \nthen display a welcome message, and then present you with a Unix prompt.

PuTTY (putty.exe) can be downloaded \nfrom this web page:\n\n\nhttp://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html\n\n\nDocumentation for using PuTTY is here:\n\n\nhttp://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/docs.html\n\n\nWhen you start PuTTY you should see a window which looks something like this:\n\n\n\n\nTo connect to \nLIMS-HPC\n you should enter \nlims-hpc-m.latrobe.edu.au\n into the box entitled \"Host Name (or IP address)\" \nand \n6022\n in the port, \nthen click on the Open button. All of the settings should remain the same as they were when PuTTY started (which should be the \nsame as they are in the picture above).\n\n\nIn some circumstances you will be presented with a window entitled PuTTY Security Alert. It will say something along the lines \nof \n\"The server's host key is not cached in the registry\"\n. This is nothing to worry about, and you should agree to continue (by \nclicking on Yes). You usually see this message the first time you try to connect to a particular remote computer.\n\n\nIf all goes well, a terminal window will open, showing a prompt with the text \n\"login as:\"\n. An example terminal window is shown \nbelow. You should type your \nLIMS-HPC\n username and press enter. After entering your username you will be prompted for your \npassword. Assuming you type the correct username and password the system should then display a welcome message, and then \npresent you with a Unix prompt.

This \ncan be confusing because it appears as if your typing is not recognised by the computer. Don\u2019t be \nalarmed; type your password in and press return at the end.\n\n\n\n\n\nLIMS-HPC\n is a high performance computer for \nLa Trobe\n Users.  Logging in connects your local computer \n(e.g. laptop) to \nLIMS-HPC\n, and allows you to type commands into the Unix prompt which are run on \nthe HPC, and have the results displayed on your local screen.\n\n\nYou will be allocated a training account on \nLIMS-HPC\n for the duration of the workshop. Your \nusername and password will be supplied at the start of the workshop.\n\n\nLog out of \nLIMS-HPC\n, and log back in again (to make sure you can repeat the process).\n\n\nAll the remaining parts assume that you are logged into \nLIMS-HPC\n over ssh.\n\n\nExercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1) When you've logged into the Unix server, run the following commands and see what they do:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwho\n\n\nwhoami\n\n\ndate\n\n\ncal\n\n\nhostname\n\n\n/home/group/common/training/Intro_to_Unix\n/hi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink3\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable3\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwho\n: displays a list of the users who are currently using this Unix computer.\n\n\nwhoami\n: displays your username (i.e. they person currently logged in).\n\n\ndate\n: displays the current date and time.\n\n\ncal\n: displays a calendar on the terminal.

Note that \nrmdir\n will only remove directories that are empty (i.e. do not \ncontain files or subdirectories).\n\n\nA faster way is to pass the \n-r\n (for recursive) flag to \nrm\n to remove all the files and the \ndirectory in one go:\n\n\nLogical Answer\n:\n\n\ncd ~\nrm test/*\nrmdir test\n\n\n\n\nEasier Answer\n:\n\n\ncd ~\nrm -r test\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n: Be very careful with \nrm -r\n, it will remove all files \nand all subdirectories underneath the specified directory.

At the moment it just assumes there \nwill be at least one command line argument. However, it would be better to check and produce an \nerror message if insufficient arguments were given:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ $# -eq 1 ]; then\n    cat $1 | paste - - - - | cut -f 2 | sort | uniq -d | wc -l\nelse\n    echo \nUsage: $0 \nfastq_filename\n\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n\n\n\nThe '\nif ...; then\n' line means: do the following line(s) ONLY if the \n...\n (called condition) bit is true.\n\n\nThe '\nelse\n' line means: otherwise do the following line(s) instead.  Note: it is optional.\n\n\nThe '\nfi\n' line means: this marks the end of the current \nif\n or \nelse\n section.\n\n\nThe '\n[ $# -eq 1 ]\n' part is the condition:\n\n\n\n\n$#\n: is a special shell variable that indicates how many command line arguments were given. \n\n\n-eq\n: checks if the numbers on either side of it are equal.\n\n\n1\n: is a number one\n\n\n\n\nSpaces in conditions\n:\nBash is VERY picky about the spaces within the conditions; if you get it wrong it will just behave strangely \n(without warning).  You MUST put a space near the share brackets and between each part of the condition!\n\n\n\nSo in words our script is saying \"if user provided 1 filename, then count the duplicates, otherwise print an error\".\n\n\nExit-status\n:\nIt is a Unix standard that when the user provides incorrect commandline arguments we print a usage message \nand return a *non-zero* exit status.  The *exit status* is a standard way for other programs to know if\nour program ran correctly; 0 means everything went as expected, any other number is an error.  If you don't\nprovide an *exit ..* line then it automatically returns a 0 for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink181\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable181\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.16) (Advanced) Modify your shell script so that it accepts zero or more FASTQ files on the \ncommand line argument and outputs the number of duplicated DNA sequences in each file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\nWe can add a loop to our script to accept multiple input FASTQ files:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\nfor file in $@; do\n    dups=$(cat $file | paste - - - - | cut -f 2 | sort | uniq -d | wc -l)\n    echo \n$file $dups\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\nThere's a lot going on in this script.\n\n\nThe \n$@\n is a sequence of all command line arguments.\n\n\nThe '\nfor ...; do\n' (a.k.a. for loop) iterates over that sequence one argument at a time, assigning the current argument in \nthe sequence to the variable called \nfile\n.\n\n\nThe \n$(...)\n allow us to capture the output of another command (in-place of the \n...\n).

            "text": "To begin this workshop you will need to connect to an HPC.  Today we will use the  LIMS-HPC .  The computer called  lims-hpc-m.latrobe.edu.au  (m is for master which is another name for head node) is the \none that coordinates all the HPCs tasks.  Server details :   host :  lims-hpc-m.latrobe.edu.au  port :  6022    username :  trainingXX  password :  (provided at workshop)     Mac OS X / Linux   Both Mac OS X and Linux come with a version of ssh (called OpenSSH) that can be used from the command line.  To use OpenSSH you must \nfirst start a terminal program on your computer.  On OS X the standard terminal is called Terminal, and it is installed by default. \nOn Linux there are many popular terminal programs including: xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole (if you aren't sure, then xterm is a good \ndefault).  When you've started the terminal you should see a command prompt.  To log into  LIMS-HPC , for example, type this command at \nthe prompt and press return (where the word username is replaced with your  LIMS-HPC  username):  $ ssh -p  6022   trainingXX @ lims-hpc-m.latrobe.edu.au  The same procedure works for any other machine where you have an account except that if your Unix computer uses a port other than 22 you will\nneed to specify the port by adding the option  -p PORT  with PORT substituted with the port number.  You may be presented with a message along the lines of:  The authenticity of host 'lims-hpc-m.latrobe.edu.au (131.172.24.10)' can't be  established.\n...\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?  Although you should never ignore a warning, this particular one is nothing to be concerned about; type  yes  and then  press enter . \nIf all goes well you will be asked to enter your password.  Assuming you type the correct username and password the system should \nthen display a welcome message, and then present you with a Unix prompt.  If you get this far then you are ready to start entering \nUnix commands and thus begin using the remote computer.     \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink1\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable1\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n        Windows   On Microsoft Windows (Vista, 7, 8, 10) we recommend that you use the PuTTY ssh client.  PuTTY (putty.exe) can be downloaded \nfrom this web page:  http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html  Documentation for using PuTTY is here:  http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/docs.html  When you start PuTTY you should see a window which looks something like this:   To connect to  LIMS-HPC  you should enter  lims-hpc-m.latrobe.edu.au  into the box entitled \"Host Name (or IP address)\" \nand  6022  in the port, \nthen click on the Open button. All of the settings should remain the same as they were when PuTTY started (which should be the \nsame as they are in the picture above).  In some circumstances you will be presented with a window entitled PuTTY Security Alert. It will say something along the lines \nof  \"The server's host key is not cached in the registry\" . This is nothing to worry about, and you should agree to continue (by \nclicking on Yes). You usually see this message the first time you try to connect to a particular remote computer.  If all goes well, a terminal window will open, showing a prompt with the text  \"login as:\" . An example terminal window is shown \nbelow. You should type your  LIMS-HPC  username and press enter. After entering your username you will be prompted for your \npassword. Assuming you type the correct username and password the system should then display a welcome message, and then \npresent you with a Unix prompt. If you get this far then you are ready to start entering Unix commands and thus begin using \nthe remote computer.      \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink2\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable2\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n       Gotcha : for security reasons ssh will  NOT  display any characters when you enter your password. This \ncan be confusing because it appears as if your typing is not recognised by the computer. Don\u2019t be \nalarmed; type your password in and press return at the end.   LIMS-HPC  is a high performance computer for  La Trobe  Users.  Logging in connects your local computer \n(e.g. laptop) to  LIMS-HPC , and allows you to type commands into the Unix prompt which are run on \nthe HPC, and have the results displayed on your local screen.  You will be allocated a training account on  LIMS-HPC  for the duration of the workshop. Your \nusername and password will be supplied at the start of the workshop.  Log out of  LIMS-HPC , and log back in again (to make sure you can repeat the process).  All the remaining parts assume that you are logged into  LIMS-HPC  over ssh.",

There are various ways you could find out the permissions on your home directory.  Method 1 : given we know the  CWD  is our home directory.  $ ls -l ..\n...\ndrwxr-x--- 4 trainingXY training  512 Feb  9 14:18 trainingXY\n...  The  ..  refers to the parent directory.  Method 2 : using $HOME.  This works no matter what our  CWD  is set to.   You could list the permissions of all files and directories in the parent directory of your home:  $ ls -l $HOME/..\n...\ndrwxr-x--- 4 trainingXY training  512 Feb  9 14:18 trainingXY\n...  In this case we use the shell variable to refer to our home directory.  Method 3 : using  ~  (tilde) shortcut  You may also refer to your home directory using the  ~  (tilde) character:  $ ls -l ~/..\n...\ndrwxr-x--- 4 trainingXY training  512 Feb  9 14:18 trainingXY\n...  All 3 of the methods above mean the same thing.  You will see a list of files and directories in the parent directory of your home directory. One of them will \nbe the name of your home directory, something like  trainingXX .  Where  XX  is replaced by a two digit string  Altername : using the  -a  flag and looking at the  .  (dot) special file.  $ ls -la\n...\ndrwxr-x--- 4 trainingXY training  512 Feb  9 14:18 .\n...  Answer :  drwxr-x---   You : read (see filenames), write (add, delete files), execute (change your CWD to this directory).  Training users : read, execute  Everyone else : No access   Discussion on Permissions :  The permission string is  \"drwxr-x---\" . The  d  means it is a directory. The  rwx  means that the owner of the directory \n(your user account) can  read ,  write  and  execute  the directory. Execute permissions on a directory means that you \ncan  cd  into the directory. The  r-x  means that anyone in the same user group as  training  can read or execute the \ndirectory. The  ---  means that nobody else (other users on the system) can do anything with the directory.     \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink25\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable25\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n        man  is for manual : and it will be your best friend!

To change to the root directory use the \nfollowing command:  $ cd /  Answer : Yes, it now says the CWD is  /  instead of  ~ .  Some people imagine that changing the working directory is akin to moving your focus within the file system. \nSo people often say \"move to\", \"go to\" or \"charge directory to\" when they want to change the working directory.

Note that  rmdir  will only remove directories that are empty (i.e. do not \ncontain files or subdirectories).  A faster way is to pass the  -r  (for recursive) flag to  rm  to remove all the files and the \ndirectory in one go:  Logical Answer :  cd ~\nrm test/*\nrmdir test  Easier Answer :  cd ~\nrm -r test  Warning : Be very careful with  rm -r , it will remove all files \nand all subdirectories underneath the specified directory.

There are a lot of lines in that file so this command might take a while to print all its output. \nIf you get tired of looking at the output you can kill the command with  control-c  (hold the  control  key down and simultaneously press the \" c \" character).     \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink146\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable146\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n         5.5) Redirect the output of the previous command to a file called  sample_1.fastq.nl .

It causes the standard output of the \ncommand on the left-hand-side to be written to the file on the right-hand-side.  You should notice that the above command is much faster than printing the output to the screen. \nThis is because writing to disk can be performed much more quickly than rendering the output on \na terminal.  To check that the first 20 lines of the file look reasonable you can use the  head  command like so:  $ head -n 20 sample_1.fastq.nl\n     1  @IRIS:7:1:17:394#0/1\n     2  GTCAGGACAAGAAAGACAANTCCAATTNACATTATG\n     3  +IRIS:7:1:17:394#0/1\n     4  aaabaa`]baaaaa_aab]D^^`b`aYDW]abaa`^\n     5  @IRIS:7:1:17:800#0/1\n     6  GGAAACACTACTTAGGCTTATAAGATCNGGTTGCGG\n     7  +IRIS:7:1:17:800#0/1\n     8  ababbaaabaaaaa`]`ba`]`aaaaYD\\\\_a``XT\n...  The  less  command allows you to interactively view a file. The arrow keys move the page up and \ndown. You can search using the ' / ' followed by the search term. You can quit by pressing \" q \".

Often it would be \npreferable if we could convert it to tab-separated-value (TSV) format, such that each read appears \non a single line with each of its fields separated by tabs. Use the following command to convert \nsample_1.fastq into TSV format:   $ cat sample_1.fastq | paste - - - -   sample_1.tsv     \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink150\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable150\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n        Answer   The  '-'  (dash) character has a special meaning when used in place of a file; it means use the standard\ninput instead of a real file.  Note: while it is fairly common in most Unix programs, not all will support it.  The  paste  command is useful for merging multiple files together line-by-line, such that the  Nth  \nline from each file is joined together into one line in the output, separated by default with a  tab  character. In the above example we give paste 4 copies of the contents of  sample_1.fastq , \nwhich causes it to join consecutive groups of 4 lines from the file into one line of output.     \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink151\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable151\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n         5.7) Do you expect the output of the following command to produce the same output as above? and why?   $ paste sample_1.fastq sample_1.fastq sample_1.fastq sample_1.fastq   sample_1b.tsv  Try it, see what ends up in sample_1b.tsv (maybe use  less )     \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink152\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable152\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n        Hint   Use  less  to examine it.     \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink153\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable153\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n        Answer   Answer : No, in the second instance we get 4 copies of each line.  Why : In the first command  paste  will use the input file (standard input) 4 times since the  cat  \ncommand will only give one copy of the file to  paste , where as, in the second command  paste  will open \nthe file 4 times.

Hint   That is,  piping  most of the commands you used above instead of redirecting to file    More   I.e. 6 commands ( cat ,  paste ,  cut ,  sort ,  uniq ,  wc )     \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink173\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable173\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n            if ($(\"#showable173\").hasClass(\"showable-hidden\")) {\n                $(\"#showablelink173\").text(\"More\");\n            } else {\n                $(\"#showablelink173\").text(\"Less\");\n            }\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n         \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink172\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable172\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n        Answer   Finally we can 'pipe' all the pieces together into a sophisticated pipeline which starts with a \nFASTQ file and ends with a list of duplicated DNA sequences:  Answer :  $ cat sample_1.fastq | paste - - - - | cut -f 2 | sort | uniq -d | wc -l\n56079  The output file should have  56079  lines.     \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink174\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable174\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n         5.14) (Advanced) Write a shell script called  sample_1_dups.sh  which will print the number of duplicated DNA sequences \nin sample_1.fastq.      Hint   Check out the  sleepy  file (with  cat  or  nano ); there is a bit of magic on the first line that you will need.   You also need to tell bash that this file can be executed (check out  chmod  command).     \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink176\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable176\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n        Answer   Put the answer to  5.13  into a file called  sample_1_dups.sh  (or whatever you want). Use  nano  to \ncreate the file.   Answer : the contents of the file will look like this:  #!/bin/bash\n\ncat sample_1.fastq | paste - - - - | cut -f 2 | sort | uniq -d | wc -l  Note : the first line has special meaning.  If it starts with ' #! ' (Hash \nthen exclamation mark) then it tells bash this file is a script that can be interpreted.  The command \n(including full path) used to intepret the script is placed right after the magic code.  Give everyone execute permissions on the file with chmod:  $ chmod +x sample_1_dups.sh   You can run the script like so:  $ ./sample_1_dups.sh  If all goes well the script should behave in exactly the same way as the answer to 5.13.     \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink177\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable177\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n         5.15) (Advanced) Modify your shell script so that it accepts the name of the input FASTQ file \nas a command line parameter.      Hint   Shell scripts can refer to command line arguments by their position using special variables called  $0 ,  $1 ,  $2  and so on.     More   $0  refers to the name of the script as it was called on the command line.  $1  refers to the first command line argument, and so on.     \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink180\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable180\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n            if ($(\"#showable180\").hasClass(\"showable-hidden\")) {\n                $(\"#showablelink180\").text(\"More\");\n            } else {\n                $(\"#showablelink180\").text(\"Less\");\n            }\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n         \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink179\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable179\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n        Answer   Copy the shell script from  5.14  into a new file:  $ cp sample_1_dups.sh fastq_dups.sh  Edit the new shell script file and change it to use the command line parameters:  #!/bin/bash\n\ncat $1 | paste - - - - | cut -f 2 | sort | uniq -d | wc -l  You can run the new script like so:  $ ./fastq_dups.sh sample_1.fastq  In the above example the script takes  sample_1.fastq  as input and prints the number of duplicated \nsequences as output.  A better Answer :  Ideally we would write our shell script to be more robust. At the moment it just assumes there \nwill be at least one command line argument. However, it would be better to check and produce an \nerror message if insufficient arguments were given:  #!/bin/bash\nif [ $# -eq 1 ]; then\n    cat $1 | paste - - - - | cut -f 2 | sort | uniq -d | wc -l\nelse\n    echo  Usage: $0  fastq_filename \n    exit 1\nfi  The ' if ...; then ' line means: do the following line(s) ONLY if the  ...  (called condition) bit is true.  The ' else ' line means: otherwise do the following line(s) instead.  Note: it is optional.  The ' fi ' line means: this marks the end of the current  if  or  else  section.  The ' [ $# -eq 1 ] ' part is the condition:   $# : is a special shell variable that indicates how many command line arguments were given.   -eq : checks if the numbers on either side of it are equal.  1 : is a number one   Spaces in conditions :\nBash is VERY picky about the spaces within the conditions; if you get it wrong it will just behave strangely \n(without warning).  You MUST put a space near the share brackets and between each part of the condition!  So in words our script is saying \"if user provided 1 filename, then count the duplicates, otherwise print an error\".  Exit-status :\nIt is a Unix standard that when the user provides incorrect commandline arguments we print a usage message \nand return a *non-zero* exit status.  The *exit status* is a standard way for other programs to know if\nour program ran correctly; 0 means everything went as expected, any other number is an error.  If you don't\nprovide an *exit ..* line then it automatically returns a 0 for you.     \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink181\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable181\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>\n         5.16) (Advanced) Modify your shell script so that it accepts zero or more FASTQ files on the \ncommand line argument and outputs the number of duplicated DNA sequences in each file.      Answer   We can add a loop to our script to accept multiple input FASTQ files:  #!/bin/bash\nfor file in $@; do\n    dups=$(cat $file | paste - - - - | cut -f 2 | sort | uniq -d | wc -l)\n    echo  $file $dups \ndone  There's a lot going on in this script.  The  $@  is a sequence of all command line arguments.  The ' for ...; do ' (a.k.a. for loop) iterates over that sequence one argument at a time, assigning the current argument in \nthe sequence to the variable called  file .  The  $(...)  allow us to capture the output of another command (in-place of the  ... ).  In this \ncase we capture the output of the pipeline and save it to the variable called  dups .  If you had multiple FASTQ files available you could run the script like so:  ./fastq_dups.sh sample_1.fastq sample_2.fastq sample_3.fastq  And it would produce output like:  sample_1.fastq 56079\nsample_2.fastq XXXXX\nsample_3.fastq YYYYY     \n    //<![CDATA[<!--\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        $(\"#showablelink183\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $(\"#showable183\").toggleClass(\"showable-hidden\");\n        });\n    }); //-->]]>",
